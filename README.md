## Abstract

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurological disease that primarily affects motor neurons. Recently, blood-derived biomarkers (BDBs) have been proposed as tools for evaluating both early diagnosis and disease progression. In this study, we compare the performances of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms in distinguishing ALS patients from healthy controls (HC), using BDBs as features. Due to limitations in dataset size, synthetic data generation techniques were applied to create additional training samples. Models were evaluated using standard performance metrics to provide insights into their classification accuracy.
